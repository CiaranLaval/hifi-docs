=========

We need your help in building robust documentation for High Fidelity. If you would like to participate, add your suggestion as a job on Worklist via http://worklist.net/job/add/ (select the hifi-docs project) -- we will pay you for your thoughtful technical writing.

How will documentation be generated?

We are building a simple web application that will parse MD files and output static web pages. Additionally, we'll parse comments out of our C++ code to build boilerplate documentation for all methods, functions, et al -- we write code fast and we want our docs to keep up!

Documentation will live in this GitHub repository, acceptin both pull requests and issues.
