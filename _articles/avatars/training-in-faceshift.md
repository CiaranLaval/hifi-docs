Faceshift offers a robust documentation site at [doc.faceshift.com](http://doc.faceshift.com/), please take a look at the Training section there.

We are only handing out Faceshift clients to those who already have one of the two approved 3D cameras supported: Primesense or Asus. If you are interested in purchasing or borrowing one from us, send an email to contact@highfidelity.io with the subject "_Interested in 3D camera._"
