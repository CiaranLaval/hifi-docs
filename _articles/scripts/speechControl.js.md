# Mac

1. On Mac, initiate the `speechControl.js` script via the Running Scripts dialog or File > "Open and Run script file"

2. Via the Tools menu, select Control With Speech

3. You should now see a small circular interface with a microphone in it. If your microphone is correctly setup, you should see some arrows pointing towards the mac and some flashes on the meter below.

4. The remaining settings are up to you, and can be found via System Preferences > Accessibility > Speakable Items. Try Calibrating the microphone -- it should hear you a bit better after you do that. Try adjusting the listening key, and maybe setting it to listen all the time for a 'initiating' command like "Computer" or "Mac".

5. Try it out. You can now speak any of these commands:

* Move backward
* Move down
* Move forward
* Move left
* Move right
* Move up
* Show commands
* Step backward
* Step down
* Step forward
* Step left
* Step right
* Step up
* Stop
* Turn around
* Turn left
* Turn right
* Turn slight left
* Turn slight right
