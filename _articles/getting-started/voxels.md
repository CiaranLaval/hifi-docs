# editVoxels.js

editVoxels.js turns on a basic set of tools for adding, deleting and editing voxels. editVoxels.js is started by default as part of the defaultScripts.js package. Pressing Tab will enable or disable its features.

The 1-9 keys correspond with colors, while the 0 key places a voxel in front of you as an 'origin' for your building project.

You can change the size of voxels with the scrollwheel on your mouse or via the - and + icons at the bottom of the view.
