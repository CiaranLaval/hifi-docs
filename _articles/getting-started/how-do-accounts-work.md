# Alpha Accounts

As we are currently in Alpha, so let's speak about Alpha accounts first. Accounts are offered per High Fidelity's discretion. Recieving an invite allows you to sign up, and gives you full access to Alpha-accessible domains within the Hifi metavers, like alpha.highfidelity.io and sandbox.highfidelity.io. The same account also gives you access to our Alpha forum at alphas.highfidelity.io and data.highfidelity.io, where you are able to manage your account.

Accounts use 256-bit encryption and all data is transferred over SSL.
