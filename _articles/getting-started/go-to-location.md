##Get in & go

After you've downloaded and installed Interface, you can launch the client and you'll automatically be connected to the alpha.highfidelity.io domain. If you're up for some exploring, [data.highfidelity.io/directory](https://data.highfidelity.io/directory) offers a list of all registered locations.

_Alternatively, press Cmnd+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux)_ to bring up our address bar and enter either the name of a location, a user, or a domain.
