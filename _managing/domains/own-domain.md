The most basic option you have is via the Stack Manager, a tool that will launch all necessary servers for you, and allow you to run the entire Hifi system locally, without even connecting to the internet.

Those with a Hifi account can download installers for both Mac and Windows here:

* [Stack Manager for Mac](https://highfidelity.io/download/stackmanager/mac)
* [Stack Manager for Windows](https://highfidelity.io/download/stackmanager/win)

If you don't have a Hifi account, you can [sign up for our Alpha](http://highfidelity.io/alpha) to apply for one.
