## The Idea

_We're building a new virtual world_ enabling rich
avatar interactions driven by sensor-equipped
hardware, simulated and served by devices (phones,
tablets and laptops/desktops) contributed by
end-users.

## The Matter

_Voxels_. We're making a strategic bet that rich computer
rendering is heading there. Imagine an experience
with cubes of many different sizes, with the ability to
scale them down to _a seamless molecular fabric_. Now
imagine these building blocks manifesting complex
physical properties.

Finally, imagine that world extending visibly to
vanishing points like our world does today, enabling
you to _see your house, your neighborhood, distant
mountains, and other planets in the sky_. We
believe computing power and network transmission
speeds are evolving to make such a world possible,
represented by a sparse voxel octree data structure.


## The Engine

_A new kind of cloud_. We're building a coordination
system enabling millions of people to contribute their
devices and share them to simulate the virtual world.

If we can successfully build this collective cloud,
we think we can enable _audience sizes for shared
experiences that are orders of magnitude larger_
than what is possible today. Imagine contributing your
computer to a project like SETI, but instead having it
simulate part of the virtual world, and earning virtual
world currency in exchange for helping to power the
grid.


## The Fetish

_Speed_. We hate latency. and think it's both
imperative and possible to have a lot less of it in
the world we're building.            

_We believe that if the latency between avatars_
(the time between when you do or say something
and when others see or hear it) _can be kept
very brief, magic will happen_. We think richly
rendered avatars capturing head movements,
eye movements, and body language offer much
more compelling person-to-person interaction
possibilities than the poorly-lit, awkwardly-framed
facsimiles of ourselves we share through
videoconferencing today.

## The Threads

_We work in labcoats_. Starched and ironed.
